## 👋 Hey
I’m into systems engineering, distributed systems and all things Linux.
I spend most of my time building and running reliable infrastructure — from Kubernetes / OpenShift / Cloud clusters to storage, security, and tuning stuff under the hood. Big fan of solving low-level problems and making systems work better and faster.

🛠️ Tech I enjoy working with:

• Linux internals

• Storage systems

• Kubernetes & OpenShift

• System security

• Cloud platforms
