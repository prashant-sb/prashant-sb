## 👋 Hey
I’m into distributed systems, systems engineering, and all things Linux.
I spend most of my time building and running reliable infrastructure — from Kubernetes/OpenShift clusters to storage, security, and tuning stuff under the hood. Big fan of solving low-level problems and making systems work better and faster.

🛠️ Tech I enjoy working with:
• Kubernetes & OpenShift
• Linux internals
• Storage systems
• System security
• Cloud platforms
